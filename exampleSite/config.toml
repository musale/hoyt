    description = """Iâ€™m Musale Martin â€“ a learner, problem-solver and software engineer from Kenya, based in Nairobi.

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics & Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem solving.

Iâ€™m currently with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). Weâ€™re making Law easily accesible, readable and always updated on our platform.

Previously, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth) and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

When I'm not doing server configurations, I listen to music ~~and you can tell I love Rihanna~~ ðŸ˜‰, I [write](/thoughts), travel, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale), and I imagine myself exercise.

Currently, I'm into interpreters, compilers and how programming languages work."""
